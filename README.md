# Mini Games Hub
Review the [To-Do-List](https://harrymkt.github.io/mgh/to-do-list) to find out what's needed.

Mini Games Hub is an offline set of many mini games bundled into 1 game, for visually impaired and this is the repository to keep the documentation as well as the website host. If documentations are incorrect and/or out of date, you can contribute.

## Updating theme
As more features are available to the theme, you need to update into your local computer. Please note that this is not required to do, unless you want to build the website from source yourself.

If you choose to do so, run the following command from the root of this repository:
```bash
git submodule update --remote
```
