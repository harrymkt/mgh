This is the list of contributors who helped the game better. Looking for ways to contribute? Remember, even feedbacks and suggestions count in contribution. Check [how to contribute]({{% relref "contribute.md" %}}).
- [Sam Tupy](https://samtupy.com/): Provider of NVGT, the game engine this game is used.
- [GitHub](https://github.com): Website host, for public contributions and to maintain releases, as well as private repository for source code keeping for the purposes of backup and collaborative contributions.
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io): A static site generator written in Go, which helped generating this website way easy than having manually writing down much HTML/JS, with the ability to use themes of my own.
- Dao Duc Trung (the owner of [ddt.one](https://ddt.one)): Thanks for giving me the idea to create a game zone, that is, many mini games bundled into 1 game. While the game is initially planned for battle game, this idea brings me into creating something that wouldn't be boring for everyone. By the way, if you want to get useful resources and informations, you should probably visit his website.
- Lastly but not miss, thanks everybody who play this game and their suggestions. Without user suggestions and above contributors this game wouldn't have gotten this far.
