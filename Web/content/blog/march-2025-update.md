Hello everyone! I would like to inform all players about this March 2025 update that contains a large improvements and new features.
<!--more-->
I would like you to read this post till the end to understand changes made in this update.

Lets begin!

## Magic Attacks
Introducing, magic attacks! Yes, you've heard right! Magic attacks are currently added in Endless Battle mini game, and magic related games will be added in the future.

Each magic attack uses a certain amount of what it calls magic energy. Please note that this energy is not saved upon exit. This means that you need to build up magic energy every time you run the game. Usually, magic energy will not go beyond its limit of 100. Also remember that this can be different when we add magic related games in the future. That being said, each game could have different limitation of magic energy you can have.

Currently, you can build up magic energy as your enemies are killed. Different ways to gain magic energy will be added in the future, as well as user suggestions are welcome as before.

Availability of spells you will gain is based on your resurrection and in some case, level, or both.

Press the M key to bring up the magic spells which can be casted if you have enough magic energy. On Android, double tap with one finger on the top right of the screen.

You may view description of each spell by pressing F1 or double tap with 3 fingers on Android while you're in the spells menu.

## Translation System
Finally, we have translation system. This is still in its early development, thus every text might not be available to translate.

How it works?
- Translations live in a folder called lang and are divided into folders with language code prefix, under each of them containing multiple files and even subfolders (recursively). This makes it easier to maintain updates.
- It dynamically translates the text, meaning it consists of zero or more variables that will be replaced with the actual values.
- When the translation key could not be found, it uses the fallback language (usually en (English)).

That's all about translation.

## New Mini Game (Archery)
In [Archery]({{% relref "/docs/archery/_index.md" %}}), Your task is to shoot a flying plane that is moving from left to right over and over again. If you success up to 10 rounds, you get in-game currency. This game fully supports Android gestures.

## Coordinates Disabled
In Endless Battle game, you will no longer be able to check your coordinates. This is because I think this is unnecessary.

One key removed, this means one key left for other necessary operations!

## Conclusion
Well, that's it guys. Please note that you should check the [change log]({{% relref "/changelog.md" %}}) to view the full changes made.

Lastly, don't forget to read the [documentation]({{% relref "/docs/_index.md" %}}) for a list of shortcuts.

**Happy gaming!**
