Hello everyone! Endless Battle game is being redeveloped after I lost my hard disk talked about in this [blog post](https://harrymkt.github.io/blog/new-chapter-begins/)
<!--more-->
So, this is the date this game is redeveloped.

Please wait while I prepare for public release after finishing up!

## What's to come?
* A complete redesign with future possible improvements compared to the lost version which would be defined by user suggestions and experience feedbacks.
* Cross platform support will be included, with android also being available thanks to NVGT's cross platform system. I-OS support is still to be made available in the near future.
