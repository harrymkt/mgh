In this streamlined version of Blackjack, only cards numbered 1 through 10 are used; no face cards or suits. The objective remains to reach a total of 21 without going over. Each player starts with two cards and can either 'hit' to draw another card or 'stand' to keep their current total. Numbered cards hold their face value, and success in this game requires strategic choices and careful moves, focusing purely on numbers to achieve the winning hand.

## Features
Blackjack advertises the following features:
- Gain in-game currency which can be used across all the games to buy and exchange items.
- Numbers only; use 1 to 10 numbers and get a total of 21.
- Wish your luck. Will you hit another card? Will you stand with what you have? Or better yet, will your best of luck pull you over to win double your bidding? Everything is determined by it!
- Keyboard is not required; Android gestures fully supported.

## What is the Game Tab?
The game tab shows the relevant items based on the selected mode. By default, it’s set to Player mode, where you can see all your cards, along with the count and total.

Modes:
- Player Mode: Displays all your cards, including count and total.
- Default: An empty view where only New, Hit, and Stand options appear.
- Computer Mode: Shows your opponent’s details, like card count and total. For security, only one opponent card is shown until you select stand.
