In this Archery game, your task is to shoot down the flying Plane that is moving from side to side. If you hit your target you get points. Each round needs a certain amount of points to win.

Round 1 starts with 16 points needed to win, and each round increases by 1 point. Please note that the speed of which the Plane is moving will increase faster and faster with each round which makes it difficult to hit.

When you finished round 10 (final round) with at least 25 points, you will get randomized 1 to 10 times the money worth your total points of all rounds.

You have 3 shots on each round. With each shot this number will decrease. Once this number goes to 0, the round ends.

If you get more than or equal to the points required for that round, you win. Otherwise, you lose. Each shot can score you with the maximum of 10 points. Thus, hitting the exact target 3 times would give you 30 points.
