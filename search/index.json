            "content": "%title% In this streamlined version of Blackjack, only cards numbered 1 through 10 are used; no face cards or suits. The objective remains to reach a total of 21 without going over. Each player starts with two cards and can either 'hit' to draw another card or 'stand' to keep their current total. Numbered cards hold their face value, and success in this game requires strategic choices and careful moves, focusing purely on numbers to achieve the winning hand.\nPlay the game and gain in-game currency which can be used across all mini games!\nFeatures Blackjack advertises the following features:\nGain in-game currency which can be used across all the games to buy and exchange items.

            "title": "Late October 2024 Update",
            "content": "Hello everyone! I would like to inform all players about this October 2024 update that contains a large improvements and a few new features.\nPlease note that this update is mostly planned for bug fixes, improvements, while adding few new features to the game. I would like you to read this post till the end to understand changes made in this update.\nLets begin!\nName Change The first thing you're gonna notice is the game's name's changed. Yes, I would like to add other mini games, so that's why the game got renamed. In this update a new mini game is added for a total of 2. Of course, Endless Battle will be the first you see in the list. New mini game suggestions are always welcome and will be appreciated.\nAndroid Launch Screen Well. Since I'm actively working the game for Android for those who want to play, I added a new quick feature at the Android first launch screen. When you launch the game from Android, a sound will play, suggesting to turn off your screen reader and to use a keyboard for the fullest possible experience. This audio clip takes around 10 to 15 seconds, so if you don't want to listen, you can skip it by double tapping with 1 finger on the screen.\nGender Selection Android devices can now choose gender before gameplay. This makes it possible to play player base voices base on the gender. When you click play game option, it will ask you to choose a gender. If you failed to choose your gender, the game will exit. This means that no madder what, you must choose a gender.\nSettings Dialog While PC versions use audio form controls to navigate settings dialog, Android had to use menu base system. This is because form controls do not currently work with Android devices. In the settings dialog, you can double tap with 2 fingers on the screen to change the state of a checkbox. To activate an option, for instance, \u0026quot;Save Options\u0026quot;, you can double tap with 1 finger on the screen. Settings dialog is usually navigated by swipes since it is menu based.\nMore Android Gestures There are 2 new gestures that get added into Endless Battle mini game which are also documented in the respective section:\nSwipe up 3 fingers to check ammo. Swipe down 3 fingers to check coordinates. Wo, near to 4 fingers, isn't it? Well, I'm simply trying to be able to play the game without a keyboard, but no that is not currently possible if you want to get its fullest experience and abilities! Also note that since the game got renamed, future updates will contain the same gestures but for different mini games.\nSome mini games don't require a keyboard to play, and they will be documented clearly in each game's about section.\nScreen Reading Problem Hopefully, I fixed screen reading problem on some Android devices by using an alternative screen reading method. Thanks several players for report! Screen reader should now work as expected, if it doesn't please let me know!\nAndroid Number Keypad Added Android number field. Uh, of course, this is simulation. Once the field is popped out you can click on the numbers you want to type, and click done button to finish. This is the only way that Android devices can type, but it will be converted to form type as soon as it's available to be! This depends on the engine that is used to develop this game, so we can currently do nothing about it.\nThere is also an option called \u0026quot;Backspace\u0026quot; to delete the last number. You can click back button at any time to quit the input.\nLastly, you also have the ability to read the numbers you've written. Your written numbers will display at the top of the menu, which is the first option you see in the menu.\nPlease note that Android version still cannot type any letters except for the numbers at the moment. Still, I'll be working on form controls.\nConclusion Well, that's it guys. Please note that you should check the change log to view the full changes made.\nLastly, don't forget to read the documentation for a list of shortcuts.\nHappy gaming!\n"

Dao Duc Trung (the owner of ddt.one): Thanks for giving me the idea to create a game zone, that is, many mini games bundled into 1 game. While the game is initially planned for battle game, this idea brings me into creating something that wouldn't be boring for everyone.

            "content": "Mini Games Hub Changes New in version 0.0.5 (build 2024.12.08) Fixed the download URL for update. Upgrades website to Hugo. The website now supports search functionality! Changes for Endless Battle mini game; These are changes that have been applied to Endless Battle mini game and thus it is best to group them into 1 for readability as many changes were made: Items in the map will now play a loop sound which will indicate where they are. Added a new weapon (Knife)! This is small and lightweight, doing only a small amount of damage though it is faster than the Sword. You should get this weapon when your resurrection is 1 or above. Now, the Sword range is increased while the Knife has a shorter range. Added a new enemy (Bear!) Be careful, it does a little higher amount of damage than Wolf. Require experience point will now randomize. You can now customize the spawn time of enemy and it is set to 10 seconds by default. Added buffer! This means that you can review informations that you've missed. For example, alerts and in-game important notifications. You can press left and right brackets to switch between buffers (holding down Shift will move to top or bottom), and you can press the Comma key or Period key to move through the current buffer (holding down Shift will move to top or bottom). Android gestures not supported. Introducing a new mini-game: Dice Match! The objective is to roll the dice, which contain two numbers, each ranging from 1 to 6. If the two numbers match, you'll earn money equal to 0 to 20 times their total. There you go, Android gamers, because this mini game fully supports gestures and thus keyboard is not required! New in version 0.0.4 (build 2024.11.17) Please note that the Android version still cannot save data.\nThis update Fixes a serious bug that the store item health drink is being incorrect. It's now changed to health potion, which is making wrong item. All health drinks that you have purchased will be transfered to health potion automatically. Thanks Jes Bel for report! Computer sequence in Blackjack will now more randomize and doesn't nearly always win or lose. Changes for Endless Battle mini game; These are changes that have been applied to Endless Battle mini game and thus it is best to group them into 1 for readability as many changes were made: You can now select the map you want to play on. Of course, there is currently 1 map, but it will be expanded in the future. Added items! Now, when an enemy dies, a random item will be spawned at its location which will be picked up if you're close enough with it. Fixed inventory item speech on Android which causes the item to stop speaking. The positional speak of the inventory item has now been removed. You can now rotate a full 180 degrees by pressing the S key. Android gesture not available. Improved in-game shortcuts announcement. At the start of Blackjack it will tell the shortcuts related to it depending on the platform you're on. Added test speaker in the main menu to test your speaker's position in realtime. Added the message that will speak upon the click of the \u0026quot;Check for Updates\u0026quot; icon. New in version 0.0.3 (build 2024.10.29) Changed the name to Mini Games Hub, and added a new mini game! Of course, new mini game suggestions are always welcome! In this new mini game, you play blackjack. You can move up and down arrows to navigate through the game's structure. When you gained dollars, you can use them to buy health items, ammos, etc for Endless Battle mini game. Changes for Android; These are changes that have been applied to Android operating system as well as game UI related to it: Upon opening the game on Android, it will play a sound file which suggests to turn off your screen reader and using a keyboard if possible. To skip the sound you can double tap with 1 finger on the screen. Android platform can now select gender as the play game option is pressed. You can now change settings on Android! Since forms aren't able to navigate on Android, a menu base system is added to it. Also note, to check or uncheck a checkbox in the menu, double tap with 2 fingers. More Android gestures for Endless Battle: Swipe up with 3 fingers to check ammo, and swipe down with 3 fingers to check coordinates. Wo, near to 4 fingers! Hopefully fixed screen reading problem on some Android devices by using an alternative screen reading method. Thanks several players for report! Added Android number field. Uh, of course, this is simulation. Once the field is popped out you can click on the numbers you want to type, and click done button to finish. This is the only way that Android devices can type. Updates will now include about update build date. Eg build 2024.10.19. Added sounds for update available, started, and canceled. New in version 0.0.2 (build 2024.10.19) You can now press F1 on each store item to get its description. Fixed speech interrupting in menus, especially with Android having speech interrupt on. On Android if you want to force speech stop while you're in game play, triple tap with 1 finger. Fixed enemy death sound not playing in the correct listener. You can now click on \u0026quot;get system information\u0026quot; icon in the main menu to get information related to system, including its information and necessary debug logs. Only do this when it's necessary, for example if you asked a question related to device issue, so developer might need to ask you that information; only provide it when it is asked! The information you retrieved is encrypted, meaning only developers can extract its information, adding another possible security implementations to each information that you provide. This also means that even if the information is published publicly to the internet, no one will be able to access its original form. Decreased jump time a bit. Improved store related text strings. Information of the weapons have been removed from the weapon draw menu. Instead, you will have to press F1 to read the weapon's related information while you're at it. You can now rotate 90 degrees by pressing turn keys (Q and E) while holding down Shift. This 90 degrees rotation is not currently available by touch. In-game key shortcuts can now display base on the operating system! Added pluralization strings to items, for instance, store purchases. New in version 0.0.1 (build 2024.10.13) First release "

            "content": "%title% This list contains code improvements or libraries that are still need to be defined, added, used, modified, replaced or otherwise changed in order to get the best possible working and are beneficial to display in public interestry.\nTranslation system Currently, we have a private translation system but it is not used yet, which features including dynamic variables and using IDs, fallback dictionary if the translated ID is not found for the current selected language, and so on. Unfortunately, this system is at least for now, but not the advance level. This system is not ideal for the following reasons:\nThe system's dynamic variables feature is not good enough to translate. For example, a {1} is {2}, about {3} tiles away. In this case, {2} is the variable which tells the direction, in front, behind, etc. However, we cannot subtranslate the part such as in front, behind, etc, because the dynamic variables feature can only translate once for a given ID. Either we must find a good system for this task, or use the messages instead of IDs, which could have more control over the translations, but we will still have the problem of lower and upper case for the messages again in this one, so we need to decide the best use of system for the translation. We could also use the regular expression provided by NVGT to determine the location of the translation strings by using wildcards all over the messages while the dynamic variables system is still being used but with improvements, because in the regular expression patterns we don't need to use the regular replace functions, since it already finds a matching pattern and replaces itself. If we made it, then it will be a hundred percent reliable translation system, but it requires learning and additional time because the regular expression patterns are tricky, so any help would be appreciated. Using this system will avoid having to change to message base translation. We're not sitting after asking your suggestions related to the translation. Instead, we're also discussing about the regular expression usage with the global NVGT community and looking for each of their response.\nUntil then, the translation system cannot be added into the game. The reason is that who will be using translation system if the directions as well as necessary informations can't be translated, such as directions (behind, in front, left, right, north, south), so it is why we have made up to only add the system after which the problem is solved.\n"
